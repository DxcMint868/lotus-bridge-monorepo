# Lotus Bridge - User Flow Improvements

## Changes Made for Better Bridge UX

### ✅ Removed Redundant Chain Selector from Navbar
- **Before**: Users had two chain selectors - one in the navbar (NetworkSelector) and one in the bridge interface (NetworkBridgeSelector)
- **After**: Single chain selection experience through the bridge interface only
- **Why**: For a bridge app, chain selection should be part of the bridging flow, not a separate wallet function

### ✅ Simplified Wallet Connection Display
- **Before**: Wallet connection showed active chain with clickable switch button
- **After**: Wallet connection shows current chain as informational display only
- **Why**: Chain switching should happen through the bridge interface to avoid confusion

### ✅ Enhanced Bridge Interface Clarity
- **Added**: Descriptive subtitle explaining the bridge functionality
- **Maintained**: Clear "From" and "To" sections with network and token selectors
- **Kept**: Swap button for quick network/token switching

## User Flow Now:

1. **Connect Wallet** → Shows current connected account and chain (read-only)
2. **Select Source** → Choose from network and token in bridge interface
3. **Enter Amount** → Input amount to bridge with balance/max helpers
4. **Select Destination** → Choose to network and token
5. **Bridge** → Execute transaction

## Benefits:

- ✅ **Clearer Intent**: Chain selection is contextual to bridging
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No duplicate chain selectors
- ✅ **Better UX**: Single point of interaction for bridge operations
- ✅ **Mobile Friendly**: Less navbar clutter

## Files Modified:

- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Removed NetworkSelector import and usage
- `src/components/WalletConnection.tsx` - Made chain display informational only
- `src/components/BridgeInterface.tsx` - Added descriptive subtitle

## Technical Note:

The NetworkBridgeSelector component handles bridge-specific chain selection, while the wallet connection now focuses purely on account management. This creates a cleaner separation of concerns and a more intuitive user experience for a cross-chain bridge application.
